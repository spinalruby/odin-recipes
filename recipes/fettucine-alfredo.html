    <h2>The Best Pasta You Will Cook!</h2>
    <p>A creamy pasta dish that is best served with chicken.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ounces fettuccini pasta</li>
        <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettucine pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet melt the butter and add the chopped garlic. Cook on low for about 5 minutes, stirring often, making sure not to burn the garlic.        </li>
        <li>Pour about a 1/4 cup of the heavy cream into a small bowl. Add the egg yolk and beat together; put aside. Pour the remaining cream into the frying pan. Increase the heat to medium-high. As the cream starts to boil, mix rapidly using a whisk. Slowly add the cream/egg mixture. You do not want the egg to curdle. Continue whisking until well blended.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup of the Parmesan cheese and continue to mix the cream. Pour in the remaining Parmesan and the parsley, mix until smooth. Immediately remove from stove. Serve over cooked pasta.</li>
    </ol>
